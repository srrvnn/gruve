	<h1> GRUVE Issues </h1>
	<h3>Footpaths in GRUVE map</h3>
	Our map still has references to pedestrian footpaths which are not supported on Google Streetview. The problem therefore is that the system might generate
	instructions involving footpaths that are not possible to reach using Google Streetview. We are working on removing those references. 
	<br/>
	<h3>More Gameworlds</h3>
	Currently, there is only one gameworld available for use. We hope to provide more gameworlds with new plots in new neighbourhoods very soon.
	<br/>
	<h3>More issues</h3>
	If you come across any other issue or enhancement that can be made to any part of this toolkit, please email Srini Janarthanam at "srinivasancj at gmail dot com".
