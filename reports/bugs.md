* an initial move is needed to get the right orientation. 'sending' without the initial move gives a wrong instruction. fixed by asking the user to move

* instruction updates happen only when a new node is reached. fixed by introducing small talk

* some streets have dual names, hence appear different on the instruction vs. on the map. 

* using the downward arrow assumes changes in user orientation. disabling the arrow might work

* detection of a wrong move might be necessary
