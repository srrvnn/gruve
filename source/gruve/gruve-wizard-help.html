	<h3>How to set up the WoZ study?</h3>
	Step 1: <br/>
	The GRUVE User interface (gruve-user.jsp) must be set to interact with the wizard as below in the webserver.<br/> 
	<br/>
	//Set buddy as wizard if you want the user to interact with a wizard instead of the system<br/>
	//buddy = "system";<br/>
	buddy = "wizard";<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>	
	Step 2:
	Load the GRUVE wizard interface (wizards-desk.html) on the wizard's desktop. This tool will be in stand-by mode awaiting inputs from the gruve-user.jsp tool.
	<br/>
	<br/>	
	Step 3:
	Load the GRUVE User interface (gruve-user.jsp) tool on the user's desktop. 
	<br/>
	<br/>	
	<h3>How does the wizard's desk work?</h3>
	The wizard's desk will shortly receive updates about user's location from the GRUVE user interface tool. This will reflect on Streetview panel and the map on the wizard's desk page. As the user starts walking, his/her location and bearing information will get constantly updated at the wizard's desk. When the user interacts with his buddy using the interaction panel, the corresponding dialogue act will appear on the wizard's desk. The wizard can respond to the user by typing into the text box and pressing the SEND button. <br/><br/>
	<h3>How can wizards find directions to destinations?</h3>
	The wizard can get directions from the user's current location to his destination by selecting his destination and pressing the "Get Directions" button. The directions will be plotted on the map, which can be used to instruct the user.	
	<br/><br/>
	<h3>Where are the logs?</h3>
	The interaction between the user and the wizard will be logged at "gruve/ilogs". These logs are prefixed as "woz-".
